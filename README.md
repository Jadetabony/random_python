<h1> Random Python</h1>

This is a repository of code that I have written with the intent of honing my Python programming skills.  

<h2> Files and organization </h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Anagram_finder:</b> Function reads a provided list and removes all values that do not have an anagram within the list.
<ul>
<li> <b>To-do: </b> I want to enhance this code to test that all of the original list values are strings. Also add some formatting to print out the values that are anagrams. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Blackjack Player:</b> Creates a deck of cards and deals out cards to both the user and the "dealer."  Uses user-input to "hit" or "stay" and compares user and dealer hand to declare winner.  User can play as many times as they want and the program keeps score.
<ul>
<li> <b>To-do: </b>  </li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Pig Latin Translator:</b> Reads in words from a user-specified text, identifies numerical values and punctuation, translates text to pig-latin and then prints translated text to a new document.
