<h1> Random Python</h1>

This is a repository of code that I have written with the intent of honing my Python programming skills.  

<h2> Files and organization </h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Anagram_finder:</b> Function reads a provided list and removes all values that do not have an anagram within the list.
<ul>
<li> <b>To-do: </b> I want to enhance this code to test that all of the original list values are strings. Also add some formatting to print out the values that are anagrams. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Pig Latin Translator:</b> Reads in words from a user-specified text, identifies numerical values and punctuation, translates text to pig-latin and then prints translated text to a new document.
<ul>
<li> <b>To-do: </b> Need to better address the formatting of the original document, such as newlines and spacing. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
